# Cybersecurity Focal Path

The Department of Computer Science has a Cybersecurity Focal Path that requires eleven courses.  More information is found [on this page](https://cyberinnovation.virginia.edu/department-computer-science-undergraduate-cybersecurity-focal-path).

A focal path is a selection of courses that a student can take to demonstrate they have fulfilled a set of courses the department has defined for that area of focus in computing. Unlike a second major or minor, it does not appear on the transcript.  Once the courses are completed, the student can apply for a Letter of Completion from the department. Courses that count for the focal path can also count for any other major or minor requirement.


The Department of Computer Science is a National Center of Excellence in Cyber Defense (NCAE-CD).  As part of the NCAE-CD program, we can offer a Cybersecurity Focal Path that meets the standards defined by the NCAE program office.
