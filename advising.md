# Getting Help / Advising

## Advising

Every BACS and BSCS major is assigned an advisor in the CS department. You can find their name when you log into SIS. This person is a good resource for CS matters but not for other things.  Your CS advisor is a great person to talk to about CS and computing issues. Course selection, career plans, getting into research, etc.

Before course registration, an advisor hold is placed on your account. You must meet with your advisor who will release the hold.  Normally, advisors contact their advisees to explain how they'll do this.

__What do I do if I don't hear from my advisor?__  If you haven't heard anything from your advisor after several attempts, please email [cs-office@virginia.edu](mailto:cs-office@virginia.edu).

## Help Degree Requirements in SIS

SIS is wrong?  Missing a class from transfer, something in the wrong “bucket”, etc.  please email [cs-office@virginia.edu](mailto:cs-office@virginia.edu) with your name, ID, and situation. It is each student's responsibility to ensure that their academic record as recorded on the SIS is accurate.

## Help with Studying Abroad

Start with the International Studies office - [https://www.virginia.edu/academics/international](https://www.virginia.edu/academics/international).  They see a lot of CS majors and know many things faculty don't.

Need a course approved to be taken during study-abroad? Both BACS and BSCS should contact Prof. Charles Reiss @ [creiss@virginia.edu](mailto:creiss@virginia.edu) for approval of courses for CS degree requirements. Except for BACS integration electives -- for those, students should email [bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu).

## Help with Internships / Career Planning

For issues related to internships or finding a job that the faculty can't answer, all computing students should visit the website or office of the [Center for Engineering Career Development](https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/offices/center-engineering-career-development) in Thornton Hall A-wing.  They work with both SEAS and BACS students.

## Help with College Non-CS Requirements

Any questions that's NOT related to CS requirements, students should [ask their association dean](https://college.as.virginia.edu/association-deans). (This is like a 2nd advisor for College students who handles issues not related to their major subject such as College foundation requirements, etc.)

## Help with Getting into a Course

Enrollment in a course is ultimately up to the instructor, so reach out to them first.  There are instances where an instructor cannot let you into a course (e.g. the course is already at fire code limit, there are limited resources for teaching the course, etc.).  The department will not override a faculty member's decision on letting a student into a course that is already full or if the student does not meet the prerequisites.  

If a course __must__ be taken in a specific semester in order for a student to graduate on time, email the instructor and the appropriate program director - [bscsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bscsdirector@virginia.edu) or [bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu) - with your situtation.

## Help with Declaring a Second Major / Double Major

BACS
{: .label .label-green }
The College has restrictions on sharing courses between two majors and between a major and minor. The student should see the [College website on declaring a minor or major]({{ site.data.externallinks.college_declaring_major }}) to learn about these, or see their [Association Dean](https://college.as.virginia.edu/association-deans).

BSCS
{: .label .label-blue }
CpE
{: .label .label-red }
See the [SEAS page on Declaring a Major or Minor]( {{ site.data.externallinks.seas_declaring_major }}).

## Help with a 5th Year Masters / UVAccelerate

The CS contact for this is [Prof. Felix Lin](mailto:felixlin@virginia.edu) and the website is [https://engineering.virginia.edu/future-grads/graduate-programs/uvaccelerate](https://engineering.virginia.edu/future-grads/graduate-programs/uvaccelerate).

## Help with Taking a Graduate Course as an Undergrad

BSCS
{: .label .label-blue }
CpE
{: .label .label-red }
See the [SEAS Undergraduate Forms page]( {{ site.data.externallinks.seas_undergrad_forms }}) for the form to use to request to take a graduate-level course as an undergrad in SEAS.  Note that graduate courses taken that are not in any way used toward an undergraduate degree (neither degree requirements nor overall credits) can be transferred over to a graduate program post-graduation.

BACS
{: .label .label-green }
For a 5000-level course, we're told you do not need special permission to enroll.

For a 6000-level course:

__College students enrolled in UVAccelerate:__ You should receive instructions from that program about the process you should use.  Essentially you will follow the procedure for SEAS students (see above), and the UVAccelerate and SEAS will coordinate with the College to make this happen.

__College students _not_ in UVAccelerate:__ The College has a policy described on their "Forms" page. To enroll in a 6000-level course students must complete and submit the "6000 Form".  However, the form will not be made available until a few weeks before classes start, so it's not possible to enroll before that time. (The CS department has no control over this policy.)
