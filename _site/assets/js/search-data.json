    "content": "Fourth-Year BSCS students need to do the following: . | Take STS 4500 in the fall and STS 4600 in the spring. | Complete your CS capstone / senior thesis requirement in one of two ways: Option 1) Take 3 credits of CS 4980 (or CS 4993) and write a “significant technical paper” at the end of this course. Whoever you take CS 4980 with will sign off on the paper as being your technical report component for your senior thesis portfolio that you do with STS during 4500 and 4600. Reach out to faculty to see what projects they may have or check out http://research.cs.virginia.edu for ideas! Option 2) Take a 6th CS elective (CS 3000 or higher) -AND- take the 0-credit CS 4991 course. The 6th CS elective will cover your required 3 credits needed for the capstone slot in your SIS Academic Requirements report. CS 4991 is the course in which we track and evaluate a “significant technical paper” that you come up with on your own. This course is pass/fail and you need a pass to graduate. | . Q: How do I come up with my paper topic? A: Here are two prompts to consider: . | Describe an already completed computing experiential learning event ― internship, personal project, non-profit volunteer effort ― that offered documented value to a specific organization, community, or group. If appropriate, indicate how the project could be enhanced or redesigned for increased value. | Propose a synthesis of ideas from two completed CS courses that connects how topic(s) might be enhanced, extended, refined, or reworked. | . Q: Do I have to take CS 4991 in the fall or can I take it in the spring? A: It doesn’t matter which semester you take it. Prof. Vrugtman will take half of the BSCS students who want to do this option this fall and the other half in the spring. If you want to do it in the fall, it may already be full, but you can see if someone wants to drop or swap. Q: I don’t want to do a 6th elective and would prefer research or an independent project. A: Great! You can go to http://ug-research.cs.virginia.edu to see a list of potential projects or ideas. Even if the idea was posted a while ago, if you think it sounds cool, reach out to the professor! They may still be working on that project or have other ideas based on your interests! It never hurts to reach out to our faculty to talk about their research or your project ideas. ",
