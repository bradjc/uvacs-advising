real-time interactive computer video games. Topics covered in this include graphics, parallel processing, human-computer interaction, networking, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.</em> -SIS Course Description</p> <p>Our course is an introductory course in video game design and production. We will focus on both the design and technical aspects of creating a game, from concept inception and prototyping through coding and playtesting.</p> <p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will:</p> <ul> <li>Understand the social and ethical context in which video games are developed, marketed, and played;</li> <li>Understand the technologies and platforms upon which modern interactive video games are developed;</li> <li>Understand the software engineering concepts necessary to develop video games (and other large systems) in a large development group;</li> <li>Comprehend the computational theory used in video games design, as well as, to a lesser extent, related fields (artificial intelligence, computer graphics, networks, etc.);</li> <li>Understand the theoretical topic of game theory, and how that applies to multi-player games (and, to a lesser extent, artificial intelligence).</li> </ul> <h3 class="no_toc" id="major-topics"> <a href="#major-topics" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="major-topics"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Major Topics </h3> <ul> <li>What exactly are games?</li> <li>Game design elements</li> <li>Game engines and frameworks</li> <li>Game physics and collision detection</li> <li>Game mechanics</li> <li>Level and character design</li> <li>Prototyping</li> <li>AI and pathfinding</li> <li>Graphics / Lighting</li> <li>Statistics / Probability / Game Theory</li> <li>Game balancing</li> </ul> <h3 class="no_toc" id="course-requirements"> <a href="#course-requirements" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="course-requirements"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course Requirements </h3> <ol> <li>Prereq: Old Curriculum - CS 2150 / New Curriculum - CS 3140</li> <li><strong>MUST</strong> attend class regularly.</li> <li>You will be expected to learn programming languages and platforms on your own in this class!

As the purpose of this class is for you to gain experience as a software developer working in a team on a larger-scale project, your grade in this course will be based on experience points (XP). Every student begins the course with 0 XP. As you complete assessments, work on the project, defeat bosses (tests), complete Random Encounters (in-class activities), etc. you will earn XP. Some assessments will have a way to retake or resubmit to earn some of the XP that was not earned on the first attempt. Please see individual assessments for more information regarding how this mechanic works.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Assessment</th> <th style="text-align: left">Who</th> <th style="text-align: left">Instances</th> <th style="text-align: left">Max XP</th> <th style="text-align: left">Max XP Avail</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Random Encounters</td> <td style="text-align: left">Small Groups or Individual</td> <td style="text-align: left">min 10</td> <td style="text-align: left">10</td> <td style="text-align: left">min 100</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Critical Analysis Quests</td> <td style="text-align: left">Individual</td> <td style="text-align: left">2</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> <td style="text-align: left">100</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Game Design Quests</td> <td style="text-align: left">Individual</td> <td style="text-align: left">3</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> <td style="text-align: left">150</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Player’s Choice Quest</td> <td style="text-align: left">Individual</td> <td style="text-align: left">1</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Game Design Document</td> <td style="text-align: left">Team</td> <td style="text-align: left">1</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Physical Game Prototype</td> <td style="text-align: left">Team</td> <td style="text-align: left">1</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> <td style="text-align: left">50</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">MonoGame Team Project</td> <td style="text-align: left">Team</td> <td style="text-align: left">1</td> <td style="text-align: left">200</td> <td style="text-align: left">200</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Mini-Boss Battle (Midterm)</td> <td style="text-align: left">Individual</td> <td style="text-align: left">1</td> <td style="text-align: left">150</td> <td style="text-align: left">150</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Final Boss Battle (Final Exam)</td> <td style="text-align: left">Individual</td> <td style="text-align: left">1</td> <td style="text-align: left">150</td> <td style="text-align: left">150</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Total Course XP</strong></td> <td style="text-align: left"> </td> <td style="text-align: left"> </td> <td style="text-align: left"> </td> <td style="text-align: left">1000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class="table-wrapper"><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Letter Grade</th> <th>XP Required</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>A+</td> <td>1000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>A</td> <td>950</td> </tr> <tr> <td>A-</td> <td>900</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B+</td> <td>875</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B</td> <td>850</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B-</td> <td>825</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C+</td> <td>775</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C</td> <td>750</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C-</td> <td>700</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D+</td> <td>675</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D</td> <td>650</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D-</td> <td>625</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <h3 class="no_toc" id="assessment-notes"> <a href="#assessment-notes" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="assessment-notes"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Assessment Notes </h3> <p><strong>Mini-Boss Battle and Final Boss Battle:</strong></p> <ul> <li>There are two tests in the course - the Mini-Boss Battle (Midterm) and the Final Boss Battle (Final Exam).</li> <li>The dates for these are set on the course calendar.

This includes, but certainly is not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Proper use of class platforms (Discord, Piazza, YouTube comments, etc.)</li> <li>Respectful behavior in class (including extraneous internet browsing, social media, phone usage, etc.)</li> <li>Respectful language or actions to course staff or other students</li> <li>Promptness for all deadlines and class meetings</li> <li>Quality work</li> <li>Working well with your partners</li> <li>Following the honor code and other collaboration policies</li> <li>Following any University health and safety regulations</li> </ul> <p>Students can and will be penalized for unprofessional behavior.</p> <h2 id="academic-integrity"> <a href="#academic-integrity" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="academic-integrity"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Academic Integrity </h2> <p><em>Summary</em>:</p> <ul> <li>Know the honor code</li> <li>Work with your team, but not any other team</li> <li>Using code from other students (from any semester) is an honor violation</li> <li>Using publically-available example code and libraries is fine, but you must cite your resources</li> <li>More information on what is allowed will be included with each assignment if necessary</li> <li>It never hurts to ask the staff what is allowed or not allowed!</li> </ul> <p>The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future.</p> <p>Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud</a>. Assessments will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask! Unless otherwise noted, all assessments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions).</p> <p>Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homeworks.</p> <p>Using code developed by previous students in the course or code written for your use by someone outside the course is not allowed and will likely be an honor violation. This does not apply to the use of publicly available frameworks and libraries, unless indicated in the assessment instructions.</p> <p>In general, we expect that you will be using code, examples, and ideas from many different websites and resources for your projects. This is allowed within reason. Wholesale copying of an entire project or any major feature from any source (the web, another student, etc.) is definitely not allowed. Using code snippts that you find to round out a feature is allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, ask first!</p> <p>In ALL cases, you need to cite all sources at the top of the file where the code or algorithm was used AND you should note all sources in your documentation. Failure to properly attribute your sources will result in a 50% penalty for the project at a minimum.</p> <h2 class="no_toc" id="how-to-cite-code"> <a href="#how-to-cite-code" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="how-to-cite-code"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> How to Cite Code </h2> <p>Use the following format (or something functionally similar) as an example citing code you use. You may not have all of these fields available, but this should give you a good idea of things to look for. Order by title of the software package. Use the appropriate commenting format for the programming language of your source code. Below is a general example of a citation format. Does yours have to look <em>exactly</em> like this? <strong>No</strong>, nor does it have to have all the fields. It does have to have enough to give the proper credit and so we can find the resource if needed.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/***************************************************************************************

If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please make an appointment to with your instructor outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu">cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href="http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>.</p> <p>If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send your instructor your accommodation letter as soon as possible. We happily and discretely provide the recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC. For quizzes and other individual assessments, please remind us one week before an exam so we can make accommodations. For team related assessments, we cannot grant significant accommodations for an entire team due to just one person. However, we are more than happy to discuss with you the best way to integrate with your team with your accommodations in consideration. Please make an appointment with your instructor outside of office hours to have this discussion.</p> <p>If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.), please contact the instructor as soon as you know these may affect you in class.</p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="religious-accommodations"> <a href="#religious-accommodations" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="religious-accommodations"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Religious Accommodations </h3> <p>It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p> <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to their instructor by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p> <p>Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework - including the team project - missed as the result of a religious observance.</p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="support-for-career-development"> <a href="#support-for-career-development" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="support-for-career-development"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Support for Career Development </h3> <p>Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. We wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify your instructor by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.</p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="student-support-team"> <a href="#student-support-team" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="student-support-team"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Student Support Team </h3> <p>You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help!</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These resources are available for BACS majors as well!

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">UVA Sexual Violence website</a> that describes reporting options and resources available.</p> <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. <a href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009">UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment</a> based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. <a href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010">UVA policy</a> also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior.</p> <p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to <a href="https://justreportit.virginia.edu/">Just Report It</a> (justreportit.virginia.edu) or <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">contact EOCR</a>, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p> <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to <a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (“CAPS”)</a> and <a href="https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/confidential-advocates">Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates</a> (for students of all genders).</p> <p>As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community.</p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
