## Which CS1 / Intro course should I take?

_From [http://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#which-cs1-course-should-i-take](http://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#which-cs1-course-should-i-take)_

If you have never programmed before, take CS 1110, 1112, 1113, or 1120. If you have programmed a little, take CS 1111 (or 1110 or 1113 if you can't get into 1111). If you have programmed a fair amount, you can probably get transfer credit or test out of CS 111x. More details follow.

* CS 1110 - A basic introductory course that focuses on learning the basics of programming and computational thinking. No prerequisite required. Language: Python. Requires a lecture section and a lab.
* CS 1111 - Only students with some programming experience may take this course. This programming experience can be in any language. CS 1111 has the same assignments and tests as CS 1110, but does not require lab and moves slightly faster through some material since students are expected to have some exposure to basic concepts. Language: Python.
* CS 1112 - Only students with no programming experience may take this course. Offered as a lecture + lab combination that meets three times a week. Language: Python.
* CS 1113 - CS1 special topics and can vary from semester to semester. In the past we have offered a version focused on a mathematical approach to computing and a version emphasizing uses of computing in engineering disciplines.
* CS 1120 - A course designed as an introductory course for the BACS, it now counts the same for all majors and schools.

Note - You can only receive credit for 1 CS 111X or 1120 course.

For Fall 2023, we are offering:

* Three sections of CS 1110 at MWF 1:00, MWF 2:00, and MWF 3:00.
* One section of CS 1111 at MW 3:30.
* Two sections of CS 1112 at MWF 12:30 and MWF 2:00.

Please see [Lou's List](https://louslist.org/page.php?Semester=1238&Type=Group&Group=CompSci) or SIS for more information about current enrollment and instructors.

## Do I have credit for CS 1110 from AP/IB/Dual Enrollment?

_From [https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#apibdual-enrollment-credit](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#apibdual-enrollment-credit)_

### Advanced Placement
{: .no_toc }

* For Computer Science - 4 or 5 gives credit for CS 1110
* For CS Principles - 4 or 5 gives credit for CS 1000T and the student is encouraged to take the CS 1110 Placement Test

### International Baccalaureate
{: .no_toc }

For Computer Science:

* 5 on High Level gives credit for CS 1110
* 6 or 7 on High Level gives credit for CS 1110 and CS 2100

### Dual Enrollment
{: .no_toc }

Please discuss with a CS advisor or the SEAS dean's office.

## I have programming experience and want to place out of CS 1110.  How do I do that?  What is on the place-out test?

Please see [https://uvacsadvising.org/placeout.html](https://uvacsadvising.org/placeout.html) for more information.

## I have credit for CS courses and want to take the next CS class.  What should I take?

If you have credit for CS 1110, then the next class you should consider is [CS 2100: Data Structures and Algorithms 1](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-2100-data-structures-and-algorithms-1).  Another option is [CS 2120: Discrete Mathematics and Thoery 1](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-2120-discrete-mathematics-and-theory-1), but these seats are very limited and we are holding some specifically for transfer students. 

If you have credit for both CS 1110 and CS 2100, we recommend you take [CS 3205: HCI in Software Development](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-3205-hci-in-software-development) as this course will count as a CS elective for the BACS, BSCS, and CPE degrees.  Otherwise, we recommend working on your APMA electives.

Please see [Lou's List](https://louslist.org/page.php?Semester=1238&Type=Group&Group=CompSci) or SIS for more information about current enrollment and instructors.

__What about other CS courses?__

* [CS 2130: Computer Systems and Organization 1](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-2130-computer-systems-and-organization-1) is not recommended for first-year students and the class is already at capacity (we are holding seats for transfer students who must get the course this fall). 
* [CS 3100: Data Structures and Algorithms 2](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-3100-data-structures-and-algorithms-2) requires that a student has had both CS 2100 and CS 2120.  Only very advanced students should consider this course and should first reach out to the instructors for more information.
* [CS 3140: Software Development Essentials](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-3140-software-development-essentials) is not recommended for first-year students and the class is already at capacity (we are holding seats for transfer students who must get the course this fall).

## I want to declare the major/minor.  How do I go ahead and do that?

You cannot declare the major or minor just yet.  More information about major declaration can be found here:

* BSCS and CPE: [https://uvacsadvising.org/bscs.html#declaring-the-major](https://uvacsadvising.org/bscs.html#declaring-the-major)
* BACS: [https://uvacsadvising.org/bacs/declaring.html](https://uvacsadvising.org/bacs/declaring.html)
* Minor: [https://uvacsadvising.org/minor.html](https://uvacsadvising.org/minor.html)
