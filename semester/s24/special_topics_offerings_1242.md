## CS Undergraduate Special Topics

### CS 4501: Intro to Algorithmic Economics w/ Profs. Nekipelov (ECON) and Wei (CS)
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: C- or better in CS 2150 or CS 3100)_  

- A student who is double-majoring will only be allowed to count Algorithmic Economics (either the CS 4501 or the ECON 4740 section) for one of their majors, not both.
- The current SIS rules are this:  CS4501 will count as CS elective in any CS major. ECON 4740 can count as an Integration Elective for BACS majors, and as an "HSS" elective for BSCS majors.
- If after taking the course, the student decides the section they took is NOT the one they really needed to in order to meet the requirement, then the two departments will be willing to enter a SIS exception to make this work.  (E.g., CS will enter a SIS exception to allow CS4501 to count as an Integration Elective for a BSCS major.)  But we will be firm about only allowing it to count for a requirement in one degree and not both.
- Students should do their best to sign up for the ECON or CS section based on how they want it to count.  Entering SIS exceptions requires time and energy, and we'd like to avoid that as much as possible.  If the section you want is full, see if the instructor can permission-grant you into the full section before signing up for the section you know will not normally count the way you want it to.

This course is meant as a general introduction to cryptocurrency. This course is split into three “modules”: introduction and Bitcoin, Ethereum and smart contracts, and Web3.

### CS 4501: Hardware Security w/ Prof. Venkat
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: C- or better in CS 3130 or CS 3330)_      
The goal of this course is to investigate modern architectures for security flaws, craft exploits on real machines, and explore novel security-aware architectures.  By taking this course, students will:

- become conversant with security issues that plague the modern semiconductor industry, and understand state-of-the-art defense mechanisms,
- learn how to craft attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in modern processors,
- identify new security vulnerabilities and/or motivate new solutions to existing attacks

### CS 4501: Cryptography w/ Prof. Lin
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: C- or better in CS 3100 or CS 4102)_  

This course will provide an introduction to modern cryptography and its applications to computer security. This course will cover the fundamentals of symmetric cryptography (i.e., encryption and message authentication) and public-key cryptography (i.e., key-exchange and signatures) as well as cryptographic protocols like zero-knowledge proof systems. 

### CS 4501: Human-Robot Interaction w/ Prof. Iqbal
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: C- or better in CS 2130 or CS 2150)_  

### CS 4501: Digital Signal Processing w/ Prof. Fletcher
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: C- or better in CS 2150 or CS 3100)_

### CS 6501: Topics in Computer Architecture w/ Prof. Jog
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: Background in computer organization and design is expected. Background on other mentioned topics (graphics, quantum, cryogenic, superconducting) is not expected. / Breadth Area: Computer Systems)_     
This course will cover several non-traditional and traditional computing paradigms and architectures such as graphics architectures, quantum computing, cryogenic designs, and superconducting architectures. The evaluation will be based on paper presentations, reviews, semester-long projects, and class participation. 

### CS 6501: Learning in Robotics w/ Prof. Madhur Behl
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits)_  
Ever attempted to decipher a robotics paper from renowned conferences like ICRA, IROS, or RSS, only to be deterred by complex math? This course is your solution. Designed to equip you for robotics research, we'll delve deep into its mathematical core at a graduate level. 

We will cover the mathematical foundations of robotics in this graduate-level course. We will rigorously explore the three pillars of robotics: perception, planning, and control. We'll commence with theoretical discussions on state estimation methods, including the Kalman Filter, EKF, UKF, and Particle Filters, progress to mapping and visual odometry, and then navigate the intricacies of dynamic programming, control, and planning methods such as LQR and MDPs. Our journey will culminate in reinforcement learning models for robotics, like policy gradients and Q-learning, and specialized topics like foundation models for robotics. To ensure practical application, students will undertake programming assignments addressing real-world robotics challenges. While primarily for graduate students, undergraduates may enroll with the instructor's approval.

_Prerequisites_: Proficiency in Python programming, familiarity with probability distributions, and a grasp of linear algebra, matrix algebra, and calculus.

## Special Topics Outside CS

### ENGR 4880: Business and Technical Leadership in Engineering w/ Prof. Jean Tom
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits)_
This course is focused on topics which will prepare fourth year engineering students for a successful transition to the technical workplace and will help students answer the following questions: What do they need to know to help them translate their technical knowledge in the workplace to be an impactful contributor? How will they develop their career?  

The course is divided into 4 modules. During the Module 1 Understanding Yourself & Working with Others, you will learn about your communication style and those of others and strategies to communicate, network and collaborate with others effectively. In module 2, Understanding the Workplace, we will cover aspects of corporate and business structures and workflows.   Module 3 is focused on Organizational Behavior which covers topics such as organizational decision-making, motivation, management, and leadership. The final module, Managing Your Career, pulls the earlier topics together for you to manage your career development and progression. The course is based on a collection of materials (case studies, simulations, articles, and multi-media content) which will be reinforced with class discussion, in-class exercises and activities, and guest lectures.  My goal is to make this a very useful and fun class while challenging the students in areas they have not had to think about before.
