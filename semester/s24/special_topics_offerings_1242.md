## CS Undergraduate Special Topics

### CS 4501: Intro to Algorithmic Economics w/ Profs. Nekipelov (ECON) and Wei (CS)
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: C- or better in CS 2150 or CS 3100)_  

- A student who is double-majoring will only be allowed to count Algorithmic Economics (either the CS 4501 or the ECON 4740 section) for one of their majors, not both.
- The current SIS rules are this:  CS4501 will count as CS elective in any CS major. ECON 4740 can count as an Integration Elective for BACS majors, and as an "HSS" elective for BSCS majors.
- If after taking the course, the student decides the section they took is NOT the one they really needed to in order to meet the requirement, then the two departments will be willing to enter a SIS exception to make this work.  (E.g., CS will enter a SIS exception to allow CS4501 to count as an Integration Elective for a BSCS major.)  But we will be firm about only allowing it to count for a requirement in one degree and not both.
- Students should do their best to sign up for the ECON or CS section based on how they want it to count.  Entering SIS exceptions requires time and energy, and we'd like to avoid that as much as possible.  If the section you want is full, see if the instructor can permission-grant you into the full section before signing up for the section you know will not normally count the way you want it to.

### CS 6501: Large Language Models w/ Prof. Meng
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits  / Prerequisites: CS 4774; Prior Knowledge in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing is Highly Recommended)_  
This advanced graduate-level course provides an in-depth introduction and exploration of the latest advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). We will cover various topics aiming at gaining a better understanding of LLMs' design, capabilities, limitations, and future prospects. Key areas include model architecture and design (e.g., Transformers, self-attention, position encodings), training methodologies (e.g., pretraining, instruction tuning, RLHF), emergent capabilities (e.g., in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning), efficiency (e.g., parameter-efficient tuning, quantization), limitations (e.g., hallucination), and security and ethics. This course will be highly research-driven with a substantial focus on presenting and discussing important papers and conducting research projects.

## Special Topics Outside CS

### ENGR 4880: Business and Technical Leadership in Engineering w/ Prof. Jean Tom
{: .no_toc }
_(3 credits)_
This course is focused on topics which will prepare fourth year engineering students for a successful transition to the technical workplace and will help students answer the following questions: What do they need to know to help them translate their technical knowledge in the workplace to be an impactful contributor? How will they develop their career?  

The course is divided into 4 modules. During the Module 1 Understanding Yourself & Working with Others, you will learn about your communication style and those of others and strategies to communicate, network and collaborate with others effectively. In module 2, Understanding the Workplace, we will cover aspects of corporate and business structures and workflows.   Module 3 is focused on Organizational Behavior which covers topics such as organizational decision-making, motivation, management, and leadership. The final module, Managing Your Career, pulls the earlier topics together for you to manage your career development and progression. The course is based on a collection of materials (case studies, simulations, articles, and multi-media content) which will be reinforced with class discussion, in-class exercises and activities, and guest lectures.  My goal is to make this a very useful and fun class while challenging the students in areas they have not had to think about before.
