# Information for Transfer Students Summer 2023

## Where do I get started with transfer information?

Welcome to UVA and we're excited to have you here!  First, __please read__ all the information provided from your school of enrollment:

- [College of Arts and Sciences Student Guide](https://college.as.virginia.edu/student-guide)
- [School of Engineering and Applied Science Summer Advising and Enrollment](https://engineering.virginia.edu/current-students/current-undergraduate-students/uva-engineering-summer-advising-and-enrollment)

Note that the CS department does not control how courses outside CS transfer in to UVA.  For any questions regarding other courses, please talk to your school's registrar.

## What laptop do I need to be a computing major?

The [laptop requirement information for SEAS students](https://engineering.virginia.edu/current-students/current-undergraduate-students/uva-engineering-summer-advising-and-enrollment#accordion97564) recommends that students come with whatever machine they have available and then purchase a new one when necessary.  For our introductory courses, this is a reasonable recommendation.

While the SEAS information recommends that students purchase a Windows laptop, this is not a requirement for CS courses.  For our foundation courses, any reasonably powerful laptop running Windows or macOS (Intel or Apple M1/M2) is acceptable.  Linux machines are often acceptable as well, but may need specialized packages.  Chromebooks or other netbooks are generally not acceptable.  When computing students get to a course that requires particular hardware (e.g. CS 2130, CS 3130), we provide students with an account on our department computing cluster to use the department Linux machines.  For later courses, sometimes there are instances where course software runs "better" in certain environments, but course staff will work with students to get things running.  That said, learning to use your personal computer as a "tool" - including, but not limited to, changing configuration variables, installing packages, setting up programming environments - is a crucial skill for any computing professional and we will expect you to learn how to do this during your time at UVA>

The College does not have a policy that laptops are required.  However, it is strongly recommended that BACS majors have access to a similar laptop as outlined above for BSCS majors.  

## What if the CS courses that I need this semester are already full?

We are reserving seats specifically for transfer students in all relevant courses (such as CS 2100, CS 2130, CS 3130, CS 3140, etc.).  Your transfer advisor will work with you and the CS undergraduate support staff to get you enrolled in the CS courses you need through a separate process.  For courses outside of CS, you will need to contact the registrar of your school of enrollment or the department that is offering the course you are intersted in.

## I have other questions!
