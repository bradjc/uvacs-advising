## I'm ready to get started!  What courses should I take as a first-year CS major?

Welcome to UVA and we're glad you're excited!  Remember that new first-year students at UVA are all undeclared and will spend the bulk of their first two semesters taking the general requirements of their school of enrollment (College of Arts and Sciences or School of Engineering and Applied Science).  For more information, please see your school's website:

- [College of Arts and Sciences Student Guide](https://college.as.virginia.edu/student-guide)
- [School of Engineering and Applied Science Summer Advising and Enrollment](https://engineering.virginia.edu/current-students/current-undergraduate-students/uva-engineering-summer-advising-and-enrollment)

If you have AP credit or otherwise have an open spot in your schedule, you may consider taking a CS course in your first semester.  But it is completely fine for prospective CS majors in SEAS and the College to take Introduction to Programming in their second semester (or third for College students)!

## Which CS1 / Introduction to Programming course should I take?

_From [http://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#which-cs1-course-should-i-take](http://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#which-cs1-course-should-i-take)_

If you have never programmed before, take CS 1110, 1112, 1113, or 1120. If you have programmed a little, take CS 1111 (or 1110 or 1113 if you can't get into 1111). If you have programmed a fair amount, you can probably get transfer credit or test out of CS 111x. More details follow.

* CS 1110 - A basic introductory course that focuses on learning the basics of programming and computational thinking. No prerequisite required. Language: Python. Requires a lecture section and a lab.
* CS 1111 - Only students with some programming experience may take this course. This programming experience can be in any language. CS 1111 has the same assignments and tests as CS 1110, but does not require lab and moves slightly faster through some material since students are expected to have some exposure to basic concepts. Language: Python.
* CS 1112 - Only students with no programming experience may take this course. Offered as a lecture + lab combination that meets three times a week. Language: Python.
* CS 1113 - CS1 special topics and can vary from semester to semester. In the past we have offered a version focused on a mathematical approach to computing and a version emphasizing uses of computing in engineering disciplines.
* CS 1120 - A course designed as an introductory course for the BACS, it now counts the same for all majors and schools.

Note - You can only receive credit for 1 CS 111X or 1120 course.

For Fall 2023, we are offering:

* Three sections of CS 1110 at MWF 1:00, MWF 2:00, and MWF 3:00.
* One section of CS 1111 at MW 3:30.
* Two sections of CS 1112 at MWF 12:30 and MWF 2:00.
* One section of CS 1113 in cooperation with the Physics department will hopefully be added to the schedule soon.

Please see [Lou's List](https://louslist.org/page.php?Semester=1238&Type=Group&Group=CompSci) or SIS for more information about current enrollment and instructors.

## Do I have credit for CS 1110 from AP/IB/Dual Enrollment?

_From [https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#apibdual-enrollment-credit](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#apibdual-enrollment-credit)_

### Advanced Placement
{: .no_toc }

* For Computer Science - 4 or 5 gives credit for CS 1110
* For CS Principles - 4 or 5 gives credit for CS 1000T and the student is encouraged to take the CS 1110 Placement Test

### International Baccalaureate
{: .no_toc }

For Computer Science:

* 5 on High Level gives credit for CS 1110
* 6 or 7 on High Level gives credit for CS 1110 and CS 2100

### Dual Enrollment
{: .no_toc }

Please discuss with a CS advisor or the SEAS dean's office.

## Why don't I see my AP/IB credit in SIS right now?

Credit for AP/IB courses and courses transfered in through dual enrollment take time to process and often must be done by hand.  Do not worry if your credit does not appear right now.  Sign up for courses based on what you know your scores are and what you will have credit for.

If the credit is not reflected in SIS after a couple weeks into the semester, then you should reach out to the registrar of your school of enrollment.

## I have programming experience and want to place out of CS 1110.  How do I do that?  What is on the place-out test?

Please see [https://uvacsadvising.org/placeout.html](https://uvacsadvising.org/placeout.html) for more information.

## I have credit for CS courses and want to take the next CS class.  What should I take?

If you have credit for CS 1110, then the next class you should consider is [CS 2100: Data Structures and Algorithms 1](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-2100-data-structures-and-algorithms-1).  Another option is [CS 2120: Discrete Mathematics and Thoery 1](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-2120-discrete-mathematics-and-theory-1), but these seats are very limited and we are holding some specifically for transfer students. 

If you have credit for both CS 1110 and CS 2100, we recommend you take [CS 3205: HCI in Software Development](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-3205-hci-in-software-development) as this course will count as a CS elective for the BACS, BSCS, and CPE degrees.  Otherwise, we recommend working on your APMA electives.

Please see [Lou's List](https://louslist.org/page.php?Semester=1238&Type=Group&Group=CompSci) or SIS for more information about current enrollment and instructors.

__What about other CS courses?__

* [CS 2130: Computer Systems and Organization 1](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-2130-computer-systems-and-organization-1) is not recommended for first-year students and the class is already at capacity (we are holding seats for transfer students who must get the course this fall). 
* [CS 3100: Data Structures and Algorithms 2](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-3100-data-structures-and-algorithms-2) requires that a student has had both CS 2100 and CS 2120.  Only very advanced students should consider this course and should first reach out to the instructors for more information.
* [CS 3140: Software Development Essentials](https://uvacsadvising.org/courses.html#cs-3140-software-development-essentials) is not recommended for first-year students and the class is already at capacity (we are holding seats for transfer students who must get the course this fall).

In all of these cases, you are welcome to get on the wait list if you have the prerequistes fulfilled.  Note that we do not allow prerequisites to be taken at the same time as the course that requires them.  

## I want to declare the major/minor.  How do I go ahead and do that?

You cannot declare the major or minor just yet.  More information about major declaration can be found here:

* BSCS and CPE: [https://uvacsadvising.org/bscs.html#declaring-the-major](https://uvacsadvising.org/bscs.html#declaring-the-major)
* BACS: [https://uvacsadvising.org/bacs/declaring.html](https://uvacsadvising.org/bacs/declaring.html)
* Minor: [https://uvacsadvising.org/minor.html](https://uvacsadvising.org/minor.html)

## What laptop do I need to be a computing major?

BSCS
{: .label .label-blue }
CPE
{: .label .label-red }

The [laptop requirement information for SEAS students](https://engineering.virginia.edu/current-students/current-undergraduate-students/uva-engineering-summer-advising-and-enrollment#accordion97564) recommends that students come with whatever machine they have available and then purchase a new one when necessary.  For our introductory courses, this is a reasonable recommendation.

While the SEAS information recommends that students purchase a Windows laptop, this is not a requirement for CS courses.  For our foundation courses, any reasonably powerful laptop running Windows or macOS (Intel or Apple M1/M2) is acceptable.  Linux machines are often acceptable as well, but may need specialized packages.  Chromebooks or other netbooks are generally not acceptable.  When computing students get to a course that requires particular hardware (e.g. CS 2130, CS 3130), we provide students with an account on our department computing cluster to use the department Linux machines.  For later courses, sometimes there are instances where course software runs "better" in certain environments, but course staff will work with students to get things running.  Anecdotally, there are still some things with the Apple M1/M2 chips that we are working on for some classes that do make things a bit more complicated.  Learning to use your personal computer as a "tool" - including, but not limited to, changing configuration variables, installing packages, setting up programming environments - is a crucial skill for any computing professional and we will expect you to learn how to do this during your time at UVA.

BACS
{: .label .label-green }

The College does not have a policy that laptops are required.  However, it is strongly recommended that BACS majors have access to a similar laptop as outlined above for BSCS and CPE majors.
