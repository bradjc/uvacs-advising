## Prerequisite Policy

The CS department enforces all course prerequisites listed in course descriptions. For example, if you take a course that requires CS 2100 with a C- or higher and you don’t meet that prereq, you may be able to enroll but you’ll be removed at the start of the semester. Obey the prerequisite rules!

## CS Elective Policy

CS electives consist of CS courses at the 3000 level or higher that are not already being used for a degree requirement.  These courses must have the CS mnemonic.  Courses from other disciplines will only be accepted under rare circumstances and by approval of the CS Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.  Additional CS electives may be required as part of the CS 4991 option for the senior thesis or to fill in missing credits due to place-out test.

Guidelines for CS Electives:

* Must have a CS mnemonic.
* Must be at the 3000 level or higher.
* Must not be a foundation course or upper-level required course.
* Second digit of course number must not be 0 or 9, except as noted below.
* Two electives with significant overlap of material cannot both count toward the CS degree.
* Up to three (3) credits of CS 4993 - Independent Study may count toward the CS elective requirement.  Credits beyond this limit may be applied to the unrestricted elective requirement.
* CS 4980 and CS 4998 do not count as CS electives.

## Double Counting Courses Policy

__BACS:__     
1. If you’re following the “old” curriculum requirements, the CS degree you’ll get is an interdisciplinary major, i.e. it is officially part of the “interdisciplinary” degree program.  Therefore, you __can share up to 3 courses__ from the BACS (CS courses and/or Integration Electives) with any other major. 
2. If you’re following the “new” curriculum requirements, the CS degree you’ll get is NOT an interdisciplinary major.  If the other major is interdisciplinary, you __can share up to 3 courses__ from the BACS (CS courses and/or Integration Electives) with that interdisciplinary major. But if the other major is not interdisciplinary, you __can share only 2 courses__.
3. It’s possible that the other department may need to agree to sharing. CS always approves of such sharing. Check with your advisor or DUP in the other department to see if they have any restrictions.  Cognitive Science in particular has some specific rules about this. Check with CogSci about this if that’s your second major.

__BSCS:__    
1. SEAS has no restriction on allowing a course to count for two majors.
1. SEAS has no restriction on allowing a course to count for both a SEAS major and a minor.

## Missing/Replacement Credits Policy

If a course transferred in to UVA as 3 credits, but the UVA-equivalent course is 4 credits, then there is a "missing credit" that must be replaced.  This could be the case for CS 2100, CS 2130, CS 3130, and some APMA courses.

Also, a student could be "missing credits" if they took the CS 1110 or CS 2100 place-out tests.  These tests meet the prerequisite for later courses, but __do not award credit__, so the missing credits have to be made up.

__For CS 1110:__ Any technical course will count EXCEPT our own CS 1 courses (CS 1110, 1111, 1112, or 1113).  Some examples include:

* Any CS course number 2000 or higher
* A programming course in another department, such as PHYS 1655 or STAT 1602
* An APMA course not already being used toward the major
* [Another SEAS science elective]({{ site.data.externallinks.seas_elective_info}})

__For CS 2100, CS 2130, or CS 3130:__ Any CS course numbered 2000 or higher.

__For APMA:__ Any other APMA or MATH course credits not already being used toward the major.
