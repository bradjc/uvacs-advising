# Info for New BACS Students

__Last updated: 10/26/2022__

## Degree Requirements:
“New Curriculum:” Students who declared the BACS in May 2022 or later will follow what we often refer to as the “new curriculum.”  This is the one that requires CS2100, CS2130, CS3140 etc.
The official degree requirements are in the 2022-23 Undergraduate Record at this link. 
Here’s a nice page with a checklist, sample schedule, and a prereq chart.
SIS automatically recognizes the list of integration electives for these students linked to from that page in the UG Record. Here’s a direct link. (But see the info on integration electives below.)
“Old Curriculum:” Students who declared the BACS in Fall 2021 or earlier follow what we call the “old curriculum” (unless they switched to the new curriculum). This is the one that requires CS2110, CS2150, CS3330, etc.
The official degree requirements are in the 2021-22 Undergraduate Record at this link.
SIS automatically recognizes the list of integration electives for these students linked to from that page in the UG Record. Here’s a direct link. (But see the info on integration electives below.)
Current students can declare the major with the “old curriculum” at this time only if they are able to complete CS2150 by the end of Fall 2022 (with a C- or higher) and pass CS3330 no later than Spring 2023.
Need more info on our transition from the “old” to the “new” curriculum?
Go to this page on the CS department website, and look through the two subsections named Undergraduate Curriculum Transition Plan and Undergraduate Degree Information and Advising.

Integration electives:  The truly official list of approved courses in the one linked to in the UG Record for your requirements year. (There are direct links provided in the first section of this document.)

More about integration electives:  We have a long document at https://bit.ly/bacs-integration-electives  that describes rules on whether things NOT on the official list can be counted, a link to the petition-request form, and a list of courses that have already been successfully petitioned. If you have questions about anything in this doc, email one of the contact emails at the end of this doc.
A course that’s been added to a more recent version of the list will count for students following an earlier year’s requirements. (You will need to submit the form described in the document above.)
But, a course that’s been removed from an earlier year’s list will not count for a student following a later year’s requirements, unless it was taken before we made the change.


Interested in the Distinguished Majors Program?  Prof. David Evans manages the BACS Distinguished Majors Program (DMP), and details about that program can be found at this link.  Students who apply to and are accepted to be in the Distinguished Majors Program must complete the usual degree requirements as well as a fourth year thesis project. This requires two semesters of CS 4998, Distinguished BA Majors Research (3 credits each semester) in addition to the usual requirements.

CS Courses:
The CS department enforces all course prerequisites listed in course descriptions. For example, if you take a course that requires CS2150 with a C- or higher and you don’t meet that pre-req, you may be able to enroll but you’ll be removed at the start of the semester. Obey the prerequisite rules!
CS electives for the BACS.  These must be CS courses, i.e. courses with a CS label. Unless otherwise indicated in the UG Record, any 3000- or 4000-level CS course will count. CS4980 and CS4998 do not count.
If you want to take Directed Independent Study, if you’ve completed CS2150 or CS2100, you can take CS4993 and count up to three credits of this as CS electives.  If you haven’t taken CS2150 or CS2100, there’s CS2993 but it does not count as a CS elective.

Getting Help, Advising:
Of course we have info on our department website.  Look through the subsection Undergraduate Degree Information and Advising on this page on our CS website.
Every BACS student is assigned an advisor in the CS department. You can find their name when you log into SIS. This person is a good resource for CS matters but not for other things – read below.
Before course registration, an advisor hold is placed on your account. You must get advising from your advisor who will release the hold. Normally advisors contact their advisees to explain how they’ll do this.
Your CS advisor is a great person to talk to about CS and computing issues. Course selection, career plans, getting into research, etc.
For academic and policy issues that are outside of CS, you should probably rely on your Association Dean, who is your assigned advisor who handles all the things not specific to your major. For example, general education requirements, changing your graduation semester, College policies, taking a semester off, etc.
For CS policies and things your advisor might not be able to handle, you can always email one of the contacts listed at the end of this doc. 
Anything listed about academic policies and requirements should be confirmed against the official rules: the UG Record.  See the links in the first section.

Other Things:
Career Services:  BACS majors have full access to services from the Center for Engineering Career Development. Don’t let the “engineering” put you off!  CS students are their largest community of customers, and they know and welcome BACS students!
You can join a Collab site called computingjobs that is only used to post announcements about projects or small jobs that UVA people or community members ask us to announce. This is no replacement for the Handshake run by the career center, but sign up if you wish.
Student organizations: The CS department has a web page with info on clubs and organizations that might interest CS students. Also, the student ACM group has created a list of student organizations that any CS major can get involved with. 
Study-abroad course approval:  Contact Prof. Charles Reiss (creiss@virginia.edu) for approval of courses you may take abroad that you want to count for your CS major. He approves these for the CS department instead of the program director. Except for integration electives -- for those, contact the Director.

Contacts:
CS has staff in the CS office to help answer routine questions. You can email them at cs-office@virginia.edu. 
The BACS director is currently Tom Horton, and if you email bacsdirector@viginia.edu that will reach him and a back-up who helps out.
