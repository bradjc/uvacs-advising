# Info for New BACS Students

__Last updated: 10/26/2022__

## Distinguished Majors Program

Prof. David Evans manages the BACS Distinguished Majors Program (DMP), and details about that program can be found at this link.  Students who apply to and are accepted to be in the Distinguished Majors Program must complete the usual degree requirements as well as a fourth year thesis project. This requires two semesters of CS 4998, Distinguished BA Majors Research (3 credits each semester) in addition to the usual requirements.

Getting Help, Advising:
Of course we have info on our department website.  Look through the subsection Undergraduate Degree Information and Advising on this page on our CS website.
Every BACS student is assigned an advisor in the CS department. You can find their name when you log into SIS. This person is a good resource for CS matters but not for other things – read below.
Before course registration, an advisor hold is placed on your account. You must get advising from your advisor who will release the hold. Normally advisors contact their advisees to explain how they’ll do this.
Your CS advisor is a great person to talk to about CS and computing issues. Course selection, career plans, getting into research, etc.
For academic and policy issues that are outside of CS, you should probably rely on your Association Dean, who is your assigned advisor who handles all the things not specific to your major. For example, general education requirements, changing your graduation semester, College policies, taking a semester off, etc.
For CS policies and things your advisor might not be able to handle, you can always email one of the contacts listed at the end of this doc. 
Anything listed about academic policies and requirements should be confirmed against the official rules: the UG Record.  See the links in the first section.

Other Things:
Career Services:  BACS majors have full access to services from the Center for Engineering Career Development. Don’t let the “engineering” put you off!  CS students are their largest community of customers, and they know and welcome BACS students!
You can join a Collab site called computingjobs that is only used to post announcements about projects or small jobs that UVA people or community members ask us to announce. This is no replacement for the Handshake run by the career center, but sign up if you wish.
Student organizations: The CS department has a web page with info on clubs and organizations that might interest CS students. Also, the student ACM group has created a list of student organizations that any CS major can get involved with. 
Study-abroad course approval:  Contact Prof. Charles Reiss (creiss@virginia.edu) for approval of courses you may take abroad that you want to count for your CS major. He approves these for the CS department instead of the program director. Except for integration electives -- for those, contact the Director.

Contacts:
CS has staff in the CS office to help answer routine questions. You can email them at cs-office@virginia.edu. 
The BACS director is currently Tom Horton, and if you email bacsdirector@viginia.edu that will reach him and a back-up who helps out.
