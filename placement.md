# Place Out Tests

## CS 1110 Place Out Test

The place out test allows a student to take a course that requires a CS 1 course as a prerequisite, but it does not grant course credit.

Place out tests are only available as follows:

One week prior to the beginning of the semester (fall and spring), through the first seven business days of the semester; then again seven business days prior to course registration for the following semester. Typically, this is around the middle of October in the fall semester, and around the last week of March/first week of April in the spring semester.

Students who wish to take the place out test can fill out this form to receive a link to the exam. The exam must be submitted within 48 hours of receiving the link. The student is allotted 90 minutes to take the exam, beginning when the exam is first opened. Students cannot use books, notes, computers, or help from other people while taking the exam. A student can only take the exam once, and students who have enrolled in CS 1110 are not allowed to take the place out exam beyond Wednesday of second week of the semester. The exam will be graded within a few days, and the results will be emailed to the student. Students who pass do not receive credit, and if CS 1110 was required as part of a degree program may be required to take some other course at UVA in lieu of CS111X; however, it does meet prerequisites. CS majors are required to take another math/technical course that is not already being counted toward their degree program.  Some examples include another APMA course, another CS elective, or a technical course in another SEAS department. 

The place-out test is made up of several multiple-choice, short answer, and coding questions. Students may use any of the following languages on the test: Java, Python, C++, C, Javascript, or C#.  Students interested in taking the test need to be familiar with:

    variables (creation and manipulation)
    functions/methods (creation and usage)
    how to read and interpret code
    if / else statements
    various loop constructs (for, while)
    string manipulation
    input and output
    arrays / lists

CS 2100 Place Out Test Information

Place out tests are only available as follows:

One week prior to the start of each semester (fall and spring), through the first seven business days of the semester; then again two weeks prior to course registration for the following semester; typically, this is around the middle of October in the fall semester, and around the last week of March/first week of April in the spring semester.

The place out test for CS 2100 MUST be taken in person, during scheduled times. It is available Monday-Friday at either 9:30am or 1:30pm. The student is allotted 120 minutes to take the test. Students cannot use books, notes, computers, or help from other people while taking the test. A student can only take the test once, and students who have enrolled in CS 2100 are not allowed to take the place out test, beyond the second week of the semester.

The test will be graded within a few days, and the results will be emailed to the student. Students who pass do not receive credit. Because CS 2100 is only a prerequisite to the BACS major, students pursuing the BACS major will NOT have to take some other CS Course in lieu of CS 2100. Students pursuing the BSCS major, or CS minor are REQUIRED to take some other CS course at UVA in lieu of CS 2100. Students should use the Java programming language on the test. The place out test is made up of several short-answer, implementation, and coding questions. Students interested in taking the test need to be familiar with:
