# UVA CS Advising Guide

Site Last Updated: {{ site.time | date: '%A, %B %d, %Y' }}

## Summer Orientation 2023

_**Welcome new Hoos!**_  

[Information for Summer Orientation 2023]({{ baseurl }}/semester/f23/summer2023.html) - Information for incoming first year students (College and SEAS) can be found on this page. Go here to get answers to questions like what CS course you could/should take, what courses may have openings, and general advice.

[Information for Transfer Students Summer 2023]({{ baseurl }}/semester/f23/transfer2023.html) - Are you a new transfer student?  We have seperate information for you on this page.

Also, feel free to search the site with the search bar above to find information about our different degree programs and answers to many of your questions!

## Updates Coming for ENGR 1010, ENGR 1020, and STS 2600

Starting in Fall 2023, SEAS students will no longer take STS 1500, ENGR 1624, and an STS 2000-level elective.  These three courses are being replaced by ENGR 1010, ENGR 1020, and STS 2600.  First-year SEAS students will take ENGR 1010 in their first semester and ENGR 1020 in their second semester.  STS 2600 will generally be taken during the second year.

Note that we are in the process of updating this website and materials with these changes!  Students who have entered UVA prior to Fall 2023 should have already completed ENGR 1624, STS 1500, and their STS elective.  (If the STS elective is remaining, the student should take STS 2600.)

## Information for Fall 2023

__Additional Courses Will Be Added or Instructors Changed:__

* Seven new faculty will be joining the CS department this fall (with three more joining in 2024)!  New courses will be added to the over the coming months.  We will post information about these courses as soon as we can.  Questions can be directed to Prof. Sherriff.

_Announced New Courses:_

* An additional section of CS 4710: AI has been added.  We will first offer seats to students on the wait list for the current section of CS 4710 before opening to all.

* Prof. Derrick Stone will be offering CS 4260: Internet Scale Applications this fall.  His short description: "This course is about massive apps. As sites grow to support unprecedented numbers of users, they exceed capacity of available architecture. Social media such as Facebook and Netflix, eCommerce sites such as Amazon and eBay constantly encounter challenging issues of scale. This course will explore growth-related challenges, how massive sites are built and what tools and techniques are used. Topics include distributed databases, service architecture and reliability engineering. This course involves hands-on design and development; CS3240 is required."  If you are interested in the course AND you have passed CS 3240, you should get on the wait list.  On (or shortly after) August 7 (when the credit limit for college students will go up), we will randomly select up to 80 students to get into the course.  (Note we may select fewer students in case we need to use some of the seats for transfers, etc.).

__Old Curriculum Transition:__ _(Updated: June 13)_

* Due to higher-than-anticipated demand, we have decided that it would be in the students' and department's best interest to offer [CS 4414: Operating Systems]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-4414-operating-systems) both fall and spring for students on the old curriculum (BSCS, CPE, and BACS).  We will still limit the course to students who have had CS 3330, since there is significant overlap with CS 3130.  
* Students on the old curriculum who have not completed the core courses up through CS 3330 by the start of the Fall 2023 semester should email their advisor and the appropriate program director - [bscsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bscsdirector@virginia.edu) or [bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu) - with your situation.

__Physics 2 Replacement:__

* Prof. Keith Williams has created a new course that has been approved to count in place of PHYS 2415/2419 - ECE 2200: Applied Physics (Credits: 4).  Taking this course will fully satisfy the Physics 2 requirement.
