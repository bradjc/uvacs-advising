This guide is currently in beta and is under construction.  While the information here should be accurate, we are actively looking for any inconsistencies.  If you find anything, please [email Prof. Sherriff](mailto:sherriff@virginia.edu).

## Information for Fall 2023

__Additional Courses May Be Added or Instructors Changed:__

* The department is hoping to hire new faculty to start in Fall 2023.  If we have new faculty joining the department this fall, we will announce any changes to the course schedule as soon as we can.  

__Old Curriculum Transition:__

* Fall 2023 will be the final semester we offer [CS 4414: Operating Systems]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-4414-operating-systems) in its "old curriculum" form.  The course will be locked to ONLY 4th year BSCS and CPE majors.  If you need to take this course, please make sure to sign up for it on time!
* Students on the old curriculum who have not completed the core courses up through CS 3330 by the start of the Fall 2023 semester should email their advisor and the appropriate program director - [bscsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bscsdirector@virginia.edu) or [bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu) - with your situation.
