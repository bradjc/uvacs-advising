## Information for Fall 2023

__Welcome Incoming First-Years!  Summer Orientation Information:__

Welcome new Hoos!  Interested in CS?  Please see our page on [Information for Summer Orientation 2023](/summer2023.html) to get answers to questions like what CS course you could/should take, what courses may have openings, and general advice.

__Additional Courses Will Be Added or Instructors Changed:__

* Seven new faculty will be joining the CS department this fall (with three more joining in 2024)!  New courses will be added to the over the coming months.  We will post information about these courses as soon as we can.  Questions can be directed to Prof. Sherriff.

_Announced New Courses:_

* An additional section of CS 4710: AI has been added.  We will first offer seats to students on the wait list for the current section of CS 4710 before opening to all.

__Old Curriculum Transition:__

* Fall 2023 will be the final semester we offer [CS 4414: Operating Systems]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-4414-operating-systems) in its "old curriculum" form.  The course will be locked to ONLY 4th year BSCS and CPE majors.  If you need to take this course, please make sure to sign up for it on time!
* Students on the old curriculum who have not completed the core courses up through CS 3330 by the start of the Fall 2023 semester should email their advisor and the appropriate program director - [bscsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bscsdirector@virginia.edu) or [bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu) - with your situation.

__Physics 2 Replacement:__

* Prof. Keith Williams has created a new course that has been approved to count in place of PHYS 2415/2419 - ECE 2200: Applied Physics (Credits: 4).  Taking this course will fully satisfy the Physics 2 requirement.
