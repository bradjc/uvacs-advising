_Welcome new Hoos!_

## Information for Fall 2023

__Additional Courses Will Be Added or Instructors Changed:__

* Seven new faculty will be joining the CS department this fall (with three more joining in 2024)!  New courses will be added to the over the coming months.  We will post information about these courses as soon as we can.  Questions can be directed to Prof. Sherriff.

_Announced New Courses:_

* An additional section of CS 4710: AI has been added.  We will first offer seats to students on the wait list for the current section of CS 4710 before opening to all.

__Old Curriculum Transition:__ _(Updated: June 13)_

* Due to higher-than-anticipated demand, we have decided that it would be in the students' and department's best interest to offer [CS 4414: Operating Systems]({{ baseurl }}/courses.html#cs-4414-operating-systems) both fall and spring for students on the old curriculum (BSCS, CPE, and BACS).  We will still limit the course to students who have had CS 3330, since there is significant overlap with CS 3130.  
* Students on the old curriculum who have not completed the core courses up through CS 3330 by the start of the Fall 2023 semester should email their advisor and the appropriate program director - [bscsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bscsdirector@virginia.edu) or [bacsdirector@virginia.edu](mailto:bacsdirector@virginia.edu) - with your situation.

__Physics 2 Replacement:__

* Prof. Keith Williams has created a new course that has been approved to count in place of PHYS 2415/2419 - ECE 2200: Applied Physics (Credits: 4).  Taking this course will fully satisfy the Physics 2 requirement.
