# Undergraduate Research Opportunities

We post undergraduate research opportunities at [http://ug-research.cs.virginia.edu](http://ug-research.cs.virginia.edu).  Please go there or talk to your advisor about suggestions.

## Research in Another Department

We are often asked if research in another department can count for either CS 4993 or CS 4980.  The answer is yes, but only under certain arrangements.  Only faculty with an appointment (regular, secondary, or joint) can offer credits in the CS department.  Thus, if you want to do research with a professor in, for example, Mechanical Engineering, there would need to be a CS faculty member co-advising the project in order to offer the CS credit.  This is not an unusual arrangement.  Often the other faculty member does all of the mentoring and the CS faculty member just "signs off" that there is sufficient work that the research can count for CS credit.  

This means the research MUST have enough CS content that it could be considered an upper-level CS elective.  One way to tell the difference is what background knowledge you need to have.  If you are applying concepts from courses like CS 3140 or CS 3100, then it might be appropriate.  But if you are just building a web page, then that's probably not enough.

When in doubt, ask your program director or faculty advisor.
