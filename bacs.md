# BACS Information

New Curriculum

Students who will have completed CS 2110 with a C+ or higher (or a CR during a “covid” semester) by the end of fall 2021, can declare the current BACS major (see "Old Curriculum") and follow the requirements in the 2021-22 Undergraduate Record.

Students who have not completed CS 2110 by the end of fall 2021 should follow the guidance below.

Currently the “BACS” degree at UVA is officially one of several majors that are part of the College’s Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Interdisciplinary degree program. Efforts are underway to transition its official status so that it is separated from the Interdisciplinary degree program.

Thus a request to establish a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science has been submitted to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) for review and approval.  The following guidance for this degree is offered for planning purposes only pending SCHEV approval.  The College of Arts and Sciences will know by November 2021 if this degree program will be available effective Spring 2022 and will revise the below guidance as needed consistent with SCHEV’s decision.

Below we will refer to this “new” degree as the “New-BACS” major, and refer to the current degree with its interdisciplinary degree status as the “INTER-CS” major.  The INTER-CS option will continue to exist and be available to students until the New-BACS degree becomes officially available.
Undergraduate Record

The official undergraduate record has not yet been updated for the new BACS degree program.

Advising for Spring 2021

If you have completed CS 2110 with a C+ or higher (or a CR during a “covid” semester) by the end of fall 2021:

    None of these new changes will affect your your path to graduation.
    You will be able to declare the INTER-CS major and follow the degree requirements given in the 2021-22 Undergraduate Record.
    You should complete CS 2150 in spring 2021 or fall 2022 (the last semester we plan to offer it).


If you WON’T complete CS 2110 with a C+ or higher (or a CR during a “covid” semester) by the end of fall 2021: 

    In spring 2022 or later, you should plan to take CS 2100, the new Data Structures and Analysis 1 course, instead of CS 2110 and you should plan to follow the “new degree requirements” listed below.
    If SCHEV approval for the New-BACS happens before spring semester (and we believe it very likely will), you will only be allowed to declare the “new” degree.
    If SCHEV approval is delayed, you may have a choice of declaring either the New-BACS or the existing INTER-CS major. But exact details of what this means and how the requirements for the INTER-CS major will be updated have not yet been determined.
    For spring 2022, it’s enough to know that taking CS 2100, CS 2120, or CS 2130 in Spring 2022 or later will count towards either degree. So plan to follow the “new degree requirements” listed below.


Degree Requirements

These are the requirements for the New-BACS degree, as submitted in the proposal to SCHEV.

Prerequisites: To declare the degree, you must have completed the following:

    An introductory computer science course, such as CS 1110 , CS 1111 , CS 1112 , CS 1113  or CS 1120 , or an equivalent course; or successful completion of the associated place-out test.
    CS 2100, Data Structures and Algorithms 1 (with C+ or higher), or equivalent


The following courses satisfy the major requirements for the New-BACS degree:

Required CS courses (20 credits):

    CS 2120 – Discrete Mathematics and Theory 1 (3 credits)
    CS 2130 – Computer Systems and Organization 1 (4 credits)
    CS 3100 – Data Structures and Algorithms 2 (3 credits)
    CS 3120 – Discrete Mathematics and Theory 2 (3 credits)
    CS 3130 – Computer Systems and Organization 2 (4 credits)
    CS 3140 – Software Development Essentials (3 credits)


CS elective courses (9 credits, normally 3 courses):
These are CS courses at the 3000-level or above, in addition to the required courses listed above. At most, 3 credits of CS 4993 (Independent Study) can be counted towards this requirement. CS 4980 and CS 4998 cannot be counted towards this requirement.

Integration Electives (12 credits):
These are non-CS courses that contribute to this program of study by exploring applications of computing to arts and sciences fields in a significant way or by providing fundamental computing depth and background. Integration electives are courses offered by departments in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The list of approved courses can be found in the BACS section of the UG Record.

Distinguished Majors Program:
Students who apply to and are accepted to be in the Distinguished Majors Program must complete the degree requirements listed above as well as a fourth year thesis project. This requires two semesters of CS 4998, Distinguished BA Majors Research (3 credits each semester) in addition to the above requirements. See the department website for more details.
