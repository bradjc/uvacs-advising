# FAQ for UVAccelerate (aka UVXL)

Page Last Updated: {{ site.time | date: '%A, %B %d, %Y' }}

This page is intended to cover some common questions from CS undergrads. Please read the SEAS's [UVXL webpage](https://engineering.virginia.edu/future-grads/graduate-programs/uvaccelerate) before proceeding. 

**Q: I plan to get my bachelor's degree in three years, (how/when) should I apply for the UVXL program?**

A: No. You should apply for the MCS in the regular way. Please refer to the sample timeline below.

**Q: But I have room in my year 3! I want to get head start for my MCS.** 

A: You still do not need UVXL. Just take graduate courses in your year 3. Any graduate credits unused for your bachelor’s degree can be applied towards your MCS later. 

**Q: What if I plan to get my bachelor's degree in 3.5 years?**

A: apply for UVXL in the spring of your 3rd year.

**Q: Can I start my MCS in the Spring?**

A: Typically, CS often admits master’s for Fall cycles so approval will be needed. If you’re admitted to UVXL and would like to start the MCS in spring rather than the fall, please contact Ashley Haddox (SEAS grad office) in your final semester of undergrad, who will submit a request on your behalf to Prof. Matt Dwyer (CS) overseeing the CS grad admission. 

**Q: What are the MCS degree requirements?**
