New Curriculum

The information on this page is intended for students who newly declared the CS minor starting in the fall of 2021.  Students who declared before this time (or have previously taken CS 2110) should see the information for the old curriculum.
CS Minor Requirements

The Computer Science minor requires credit for six CS courses as described below. Any undergraduate student in the university who will complete the requirements for the CS minor before graduation can submit the minor application form during the first week of their final semester in order to graduate with the CS Minor listed on their transcript.  (See Declaring a Major or Minor.)

To obtain a minor in computer science, a student must complete the following requirements:

    CS 1110 / 1111 / 1112 / 1113 - Introduction to Programming (Credits: 3)

    CS 2100 - Data Structures and Algorithms 1 (Credits: 3)

    CS 2120 - Discrete Mathematics and Theory 1 (Credits: 3)

    CS 2130 - Computer Systems and Organization 1 (Credits: 4)

    CS 3140 - Software Development Essentials (Credits: 3)

    One additional CS course numbered 3000 or higher

Students with a computer science or computer engineering major are ineligible for the CS minor.

Any student who completes all of the requirements for a minor in Computer Science before graduation will be awarded the minor if they submit the minor request form at the beginning of their graduation semester.
